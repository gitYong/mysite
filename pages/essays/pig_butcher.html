Even from a window way down the hall, I could see a small flurry of snow. None of it stuck to the ground of course but even that sight was enough to distract any attention from the character sheet I should have been working on. These assignments happened every day. Snow didn’t even fall every year.
<br><br>
I slid out of my chair, careful not to slide my chair out, or I suppose more specifically not to produce the sound of a chair sliding out from the table. I slid my sandals off and started walking across the hall, letting my heel cushion each step and the creaking of the floor. As I passed the kitchen, I made sure each step matched the rhythm of my mother’s loud cabbage chopping so as to mask my steps. Then I sprinted. 
<br><br>
Snow doesn’t stick to the ground here but still created a refreshing backdrop against all the red decorations posted for the New Year’s celebration. Even the countryside was busy, busy with mothers putting the last patches on their children’s best silk clothes, busy with children trying to play busy, busy with the beheading of livestock. Come to think of it, when was the time for our own pig slaughter?
"Hey Xinlei, better get back before Ma sees your running from work again," came the sound of my brother’s from behind me. His voice was only slightly hushed, just quiet enough that Ma would not hear, but loud enough that he could feel like he was threatening me.
"Get out of here," I hissed, widening my eyes in my attempt to give him my best death glare. "And don’t you have the same work to do?"
<br><br>
"It’s done," he replied with his taunting little half smile. 
<br><br>
"Then go outside already, and leave me alone already."
<br><br>
"I’m going to, but first had to tell you that Pa is taking me out with second uncle and third uncle to the pig slaughter."
<br><br>
"Wait what!? I want to go!"
<br><br>
"Dad said I get to go! Since I am of age now."
<br><br>
"I’m your older sister."
<br><br>
"Yeah by what, 20 minutes?"
<br><br>
"That just means you’ve always been slow. And doesn’t mean Pa should stop me from going as well." 
<br><br>
"Xinlei, Jialei what are you both doing," came the screech of my mother’s voice. I had delivered my brother exactly the result he wanted and only just realized. 
<br><br>
"I finished all my work," Jialei chirped eagerly, adding a little skip to his step. 
<br><br>
"Well Xinlei, I don’t understand why your face isn’t buried inside a book right now. And you both know not to stand near the window when the draft can get in so easily."
<br><br>
"Well, I gotta go anyways," my brother responded, climbing up the stairs still with that annoying little skip. "I have to get into my work clothes before Pa gets impatient." Ma turns to me, one eyebrow slightly raised and not a word uttered.
<br><br>
"Why does Jialei get to go out to the pig slaughter?" I demanded unsure where I found the will to hold my ground, let alone speak up to Ma. Both her eyes now widened. Just for an instant there was surprise, lasting as long as a pile gunpowder before a spark.
<br><br>
"Go finish your work." I had braced for an explosion, instead her cold voice dug like a knife into my thigh, a cut that was meant to hurt not kill. I trudged back, knowing she would not budge.</p>

I woke to laughter right outside the house, the sound of third uncle laughing at a joke that wasn’t funny. On every subject, third uncle was deferent to his older brothers; if only Jialei could take a leaf from his book. To my left, Jialei’s bed was empty, sheets folded just neatly enough that mother would not yell at him if she awoke. I was impressed that he had been quiet enough not to wake me, a meaningless effort of course since the noise of Pa and the uncles working would be more than enough to wake me.
<br><br>
I slipped out of bed, changed into a winter shawl and walked out, creaking the door just slightly. My movements were not silent, but quiet enough since Ma had spent the entire day cooking and washing. It would be inaccurate to claim she was asleep; passed out would be more appropriate.
<br><br>
In my imagination, I was a spy, following my father and my brother and my uncles to their destination, trailing behind but concealed behind a bush when they looked back. In reality the ground was far too level and the buildings far too scattered for such antics. Unlike Jialei, I knew the trails anyways.
<br><br>
Their preparations were finished when I arrived, hidden behind a side door to the barn. From the conversations that Pa has with the marketman, I’ve heard that they now make poisons for the pigs, so that they feel as if they’re about to go into a deep sleep. My father rejected these proposals, taking on the tradition as his father had and his father before him. Years of practice gave my father precision, thick farmer’s muscles and dexterity gave him speed. The pigs were bound, then with one swipe across the jugular and the pig would squeal but this squeal would fade into a frothing cough and then silence as it just stares at you.
<br><br>
Jialei watched the first pig and winced. He watched the second and third and fourth as well but with sideways glances and long blinks. Then he looked away and he sat near the entrance of the farm. Second uncle and third uncle chuckled slightly and third uncle took off his bloodied glove and went over to put a comforting hand over Jialei’s shoulder.
<br><br>
"He’ll figure it out." Pa said tersely. 
<br><br>
"Pa please no more." I said in a soft voice, stepping up to the entrance of the barn.
<br><br>
"Xinlei! What are you doing here?" he demanded. "You can’t be here right now." His tone was conflicted, as if he were deciding whether it was more important to get me home or to finish the task so late into the night. "You need to know your place." He finally said decisively.
<br><br>
"Yeah, go back to the house," Jialei chimed. That punk, the one who had looked away; what right did he have to chime in? Pa dropped the blade, ripped off the gloves and came to pick me up, ready to haul me home. 
<br><br>
I swiped his hand away and ran over to the blade. In a fit, I charged over to the pens and began slashing at the smallest pig I could find. I didn’t have my Pa’ experience I didn’t have Pa’s muscles and I slashed and I stabbed. The pig squealed out but this time the squealing did not fade. It began to kick but it did not have the blood or the energy to charge. I slashed and I stabbed. Then I heard the ripping of cloth on my upswing. 
<br><br>
Pa had tried to rip the blade out of my hand. The cut was not deep in Pa’s arm, still he groaned and he winced. I dropped my knife. Second and third uncle quickly ran over, ripping off one of their shirt sleeves and wrapped the cloth around Pa’s arm. I sat down and stared as the pig walked then crawled around in its panicked state, squealing all the while. Then the squealing stopped.

Author's Reflection:
<br><br>
First practice writing a story from a girl’s perspective. It’s often said that women are able to write accurate male characters, while the converse is often not true. Regardless of the validity of this statement, it was an interesting experience for me to break out of my comfort zone (ever so slightly) and write from a perspective could not be developed from my immediate thoughts.
<br><br>
The background to the story comes from stories my mother would tell me, about the slaughter of pigs in preparation for the Chinese New Year feast every year, truly a gruesome process as she would describe it. 
<br><br>
In terms of establishing characters, I felt like here I was largely drawing from Alice Munro, in particular her short story Boys and Girls. The sexist nature of the environment (I hope) should have been quite clear: the duties and privileges of boys versus girls and similarly men versus women. I am reasonably happy with how the dialogue turned out (may experiment with infusing more of the Chinese language in the future) but wish that the sexism could have been drawn out somewhat more subtly.
