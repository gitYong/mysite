    <h1> The Writer's Burden </h1>

    <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">An interesting point was once proposed to me by an English professor: Any thought that we could possibly attain is bound by the limits of our language. A bit of a conceited statement, but also logical that it would come from a man who has devoted much of his life to the study and perfection of languages. As a boy deeply and even arrogantly focused on the sciences at the time, I immediately rejected the idea. I attempted a reasonably axiomatic argument, a proof by counterexample in fact. The point I used was simple: those moments when you attempt to express an idea and find yourself tongue-tied in the expression of this idea, be it an object, a state, or even an emotion. As one may imagine the story does not end there otherwise the purpose of my introduction would have been lost. 
    <br><br>
    As I have come to realize from a series of courses in proofs and mathematics, logical fallacies are frequent and easy to fall into. In this case, it could be interpreted as something as easy as a misinterpretation of technicalities: not having the language, in your mind at that precise moment, needed to describe an idea is very different from the scope of a language’s ability to cater to our thoughts and expression.
    <br><br>
    So, are our thoughts limited by the expanse of language? Rather than present a coherent and logical argument pointing in direct support of one side, I am going to present an outpouring of various thoughts, dumped across several sheets of paper. Then, like a true artist, I will then proceed to claim that the argument is hidden somewhere within these scattered pages and encourage the reader to seek out the meaning that lies underneath, regardless of whether it is present or not. 
    <br><br>
    My first thought comes from the antiquated expression: "a picture is worth a thousand word" (oh come on you had to have seen that coming). As an aspiring writer with little talent in photography, painting, sculpting, drawing or even doodling that expression touches on a sensitive point. Do I have to write significantly more to compensate or is my work simply worth less?
    <br><br>
    I suppose the compensation is that writers very often do get more than a thousand words. And what I mean from the previous statement, besides the blunt literal sense, is that writers often have the privilege of a story arc, dialogue, and scenery description. Within writing, a loser leash is placed around the spectator (let’s call them the reader in this case). Despite the shorter leash, it is still the writer’s job to navigate the reader through their craft, the written text.
    <br><br>
    So what is the writer’s burden then? I would argue it is in creating the scene for their subjects, allowing them to have a smooth transition from the symbols on a sheet of paper into the world that they have spun together in their own minds: relating perception to their craft of literature. One of the clearest memories I have of relating perception and literature is in an exercise my junior-year English teacher had us perform. One student was told to go outside, along with another set of instructions that were unknown to the rest of the students at the time. You will soon see the irony in my describing his actions for this essay; however, essentially he walked outside to the front lawn, where we could see him through the window. There, he performed a set of 3 jumping jacks, spun around twice, shrugged his shoulders slightly, then walked back into the classroom. The exercise itself was simple: "describe what you saw."
    <br><br>
    Five minutes later or perhaps slightly more for some pencils were placed down at the behest of our teacher. In classic high school style, we went around in a circle, each of us sharing the description we had just written. Given the fair number of our entries which were reserved exclusively for our teacher, I was actually quite surprised that everyone was instructed to share. In a class of 26, a wide range of possibilities was delivered: from the simple description I provided above (at the time, I thought I could impress the teacher with a simple series of statements since I knew he enjoyed Hemingway’s simplicity of text) to 2-page long descriptions, which encapsulated every aspect of the event that could have passed through a person’s mind, from the lushness of the field to the awkwardness in the student’s shrug. 
    <br><br>
    Yet at the end of the day, no matter the length or detail, there was no way to even see much less describe and encapsulate every minutia of the event. It was a powerful lesson in writing and storytelling. Regardless of the motive, whether out of necessity or artistic effect, certain details are left out. The burden of the writer is in crafting a piece which strikes a balance and can encapsulate the mind of the artist with the finite limit of text at our disposal.
